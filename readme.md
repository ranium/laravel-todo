# Laravel Sample Todo Application

## About this sample application

This sample application was built by [Abbas Ali](https://github.com/abbasali) to present in a talk/workshop for [Nagpur Laravel](https://allevents.in/org/laravel-nagpur/14814865) April 2019 meetup. This app demonstrates the following concepts and best practices:

- RESTful routes and their naming conventions.
- How to break various actions on a model into separate controllers.
- Repository design pattern to abstract the data layer.
- Security and Authorization.
- Effective use of Jobs.
- Presenters.

Please read the code to understand all of the above points. Should you have any suggestions or better way of doing things, please open a PR and I will be more than happy to learn from you.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.
